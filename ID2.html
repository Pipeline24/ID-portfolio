                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Im originally from Long Island, NY but I recently moved to Brooklyn. I am an inspiring software engineer. I originally went 
                    to school to pursue psychology but lost interest over time. I wanted a job where I could be creative and technical at the same time.
                     During the pandemic I kept seeing people transform their lives by breaking into tech. I was hesitant at first but I decided to take up coding part time. 
                    I did so by coding on a free website called codeacademy. I liked what I was learning but I wasn't ready to take the plunge yet. 
                    However, earlier this year I mustered up the courage to finally apply to the self paced program at Coding Temple. Even though 
                    I still have much to learn, I'm very excited to learn as much as I can and one day start a new career as a software engineer!  </p>
